👋 Hello, fellow code adventurer! I’m @josephrayj – your go-to guide for navigating the wild, wild web of programming.

👀 What am I into? Think of me as a tech enthusiast with a taste for the extraordinary: from creating digital art with algorithms to hacking together futuristic solutions that might make even Tony Stark raise an eyebrow.

🌱 Currently learning how to turn caffeine into code at an Olympic level. (So far, my code is 90% coffee and 10% brilliance.)

💞️ Let’s join forces if you’re up for a coding adventure that might include epic debugging duels and legendary feature builds. Bonus points if you can appreciate a good coding meme or two.

📫 Want to connect? Drop me a message or just send a virtual high-five. Either way, I’m all ears (and semicolons).

😄 Pronouns: He/Him – or as my code likes to think, “The One Who Knows All.”

⚡ Fun fact: I once coded a program that predicted pizza delivery times with 99% accuracy. I’m still waiting for my Nobel Prize in Fast Food Technology.
